                    Created by Facebook, React contains a collection of reusable JavaScript code snippets used for user interface
                    (UI) building called components. React allows to create UI both  on web apps and mobile ( React Native). Library is
                    really popular nowadays and have a huge community.

                     Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS,
                    styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles
                    â€“ using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!

                    Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called "actions".
                    It serves as a centralized store for state that needs to be used across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the
                    state can only be updated in a predictable fashion. I used it to create state that allows me get data from firebase in
                    another part of my application. Redux make project more scalable and menage data faster and cleaner.
